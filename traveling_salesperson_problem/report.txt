1. Hours to complete the project: 12 hours

2. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Tour Data Type): To go about solving this problem, I just looked
   at the pdf and went online to Piazza for reference. Issues I encountered were
   implementing the distance method and the insert methods. I eventually figured
   them out.

   Problem 2 (Nearest Neighbor Heuristic): This program was pretty straight up
   and clear. THe only issue I had was with the drawing, but all I had to do was
   move something out of the while loop and fix some order.

   Problem 3 (Smallest Increase Heuristic): This file was also pretty straight
   forward. All I had to do was take what I used in the Nearest Neigbor
   Heuristic and modify it to suit this file.

3. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS110 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

   Name               Status       Help Received
   ----               ------       -------------

   ...                ...          ...

4. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   Overall, I thought this project pretty cool. I'm satisfied and feel rewarded
   for working on this project. It's interesting to know that this is how 
   those who work in logistics have to think when it comes to finding a more
   optimal way of delivering.
