1. Hours to complete the project: 48 hours

2. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Ring Buffer): I went about doing this by watching the
   screencast and using the pdf. At first, I had to think a lot about
   understanding the concepts and writing the defitinions correctly.
   I made a mistake with the ordering of how I assigned parts of the list
   in the enqueue and dequeue definitions. However, I eventually got things
   to work.

   Problem 2 (Guitar String): Similarly, I used the screencast and the pdf
   to assist me here. I initially made the mistake of writing some parts of
   it internally, when I was supposed to only be using implementations from
   ring_buffer.py. After some debugging and utilizing the ring_buffer API 
   correctly, I was all set.

   Problem 3 (Interactive Guitar Player): Once again, I paid attention to the
   pdf and the screencast. However, I struggled big time with this part of 
   the project because it took me some time to understand what it meant to 
   create a list of guitar_string objects. Unfortunately, I am out of time
   to fix whatever is left for me to fix in this part of the program.

3. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS110 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

4. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   For what I gained from this project, I enjoyed it. I feel bad that I failed
   to complete the projects completely.
